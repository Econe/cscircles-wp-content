If you are seeking to make a complete clone of the CS Circles site, this
requires contacting us for permission. We will give you a file called something
like computersciencecircles.wordpress.yyyy-mm-dd.xml and these are the steps
needed to install its contents.


Installing CS Circles Content

- Get latest cscircles repo ("git pull", save plugin-config.php elsewhere first & restore after)

- Plugins->Installed Plugins: activate Python in a Box, Polylang, LaTeX, WordPress Importer if not already activated

- double-check that theme is installed & configured (see wp-content/README.md)

File Import

The wordpress mechanism requires uploading the .xml file first, which needs a directory permission.

- create wp-content/upload and make it webserver writeable (either chmod a+rw it, or sudo chgrp apache it followed by chmod g+rw)

- go to Tools->Import->WordPress, upload the .xml file

- Assign all posts to your admin account; not necessary to import attachments

- ignore errors (related to attachments/images, not important)

Settings

- Settings->Reading, change front page to "0: Hello!"

- Settings->Languages->Settings Tab, (i) set default language to English (ii) turn off "Detect browser language"

- Appearance->Menus, pick the English menu, at bottom check "Primary Menu English"

- Settings->Permalinks, change to "Post name"

- as instructed on that page, copy text from bottom of page and copy to wordpress/.htaccess file

- [admin menu in top, 3 spots from right]->"Visiting this page will rebuild problem-lesson DB"

Check if it worked:

- [admin's user menu in top right corner]->"My progress" 

Does it look like the page on the official CS Circles site?

Try solving some problems. Then look at your progress page again; does it reflect what you did?
