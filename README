Computer Science Circles
========================
This repository contains what you need to run an open-source
version of the Computer Science Circles website,
 http://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca
on your own computer.

Specifically, this folder plays the role of the wp-content
directory in your WordPress installation.

Using as a drop-in replacement
==============================
If you are starting from scratch, you can use this approach:

Installing Wordpress:
- get database permissions from a database admin
- unzip http://wordpress.org/latest.zip in your public_html
- copy wp-config-sample.php to wp-config.php and edit
- visit WordPress in your browser and follow account setup
- for more info see: http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress

Replacing wp-content:
- in a shell, enter the wordpress directory
- delete wp-content or rename to wp-content-backup
- git clone https://github.com/cemc/cscircles-wp-content.git wp-content
  which copies tour git repo into a new wp-content directory
